36% more credible sets from GWAS Catalog data

Thanks to the merge of Open Targets Genetics data and analysis pipelines into the Open Targets Platform, we can easily pull, finemap, and analyse GWAS data. Where possible, we fine-map and colocalise publication results curated and available through the GWAS Catalog.

The latest GWAS Catalog data in this release adds 36% more credible sets to the Platform from 211 publications.

One of these publications is a large multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis for osteoarthritis, combining 87 datasets. Published in Nature in April this year, Hatzikotoulas, Southam, Stefansdottir, Boer, McDonald, et al. integrated their GWAS findings with functional genomics data from relevant tissues, identifying 700 genes with high confidence of being involved in osteoarthritis, and eight biological processes key to the disease development, including circadian clock and glial cell functions.



GWAS credible sets from Hatzikotoulas et al. (GCST90566795). Our analyses established 203 95% GWAS credible sets associated with this study.

VA Million Veteran Program data

80% of new credible sets in this release derive from studies from the VA Million Veteran Program, an ongoing prospective cohort study and the largest multipopulation biobank to date. Verma, Huffman, Rodriguez, Conery, Liu et al. (2024) conducted Genome Wide Association Studies with over 635,000 participants, identifying more than 26,000 variant-trait associations across 1270 traits.

Our processing of the results from this publication contributed 172,000 credible sets that inform our Locus-to-Gene predictions. This included the first genetic evidence in the Platform for the association between ESR1 and osteoporosis.



GWAS associations widget for ESR1 on the osteoporosis associations page. ESR1 is a known target for osteoporosis, with approved drugs such as Estradiol. GWAS data from the VA Million Veteran Program is the first genetic evidence available in the Platform that supports this association. Both GWAS and eQTL colocalisations support the link between ESR1 and osteoporosis.

Changes to GWAS Catalog data in the Platform

We have made the decision to remove case-case studies from our GWAS data, for a total of 77 studies. Case-case studies are difficult to map to the correct disease, and therefore confound target-disease associations. 




Nominating potential targets using target interactors

This release comes with a new Target Interactors view, which allows you to access association data for interactors of a given target, to quickly pinpoint other — potentially more favourable — targets, within the same network.

Target interactors can be viewed directly within the main ‘Associations on the Fly’ page. This is an option available for each target on a disease associations page; note that the interaction data is disease-agnostic.

Users can choose one of four sources of molecular interactors —  IntAct (binary physical interactions), Reactome (pathway-based interactions), Signor (directional, causal interactions), and String (functional interactions) — and view the association evidence for the top scoring molecular interactors for that database. We’ve set default cutoff interactions scores which you can adjust.



Target interactors subview for IFNAR1 in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The subview shows target-disease associations for targets identified by IntAct as interacting with IFNAR1, and you can view evidence for the association of each interactor. Here, the view is displaying GWAS associations evidence linking TYK2 to SLE. The Platform does not have direct genetic evidence to link IFNAR1 to SLE, but there is an approved therapy, Anifrolumab, targeting IFNAR1 for SLE. Browsing interactors data shows that IFNAR1 interacts with TYK2, which has a well-known genetic association to SLE.
Find out more about target interactors in our documentation.




New data downloads page and Croissant

We have revamped our data downloads page, making it easier for you to find the dataset you need. In addition to the description, each of the 37 datasets now features a data category tag, to make it easier for you to filter. You can view the schema for each dataset, including column descriptions, primary and foreign keys, and the data access options.

Croissant

We have described our data following the Croissant metadata standard format, based on JSON-LD, developed by ML-Commons. The Croissant format simplifies how data is used by ML models, and will make Open Targets Platform data discoverable and FAIRer.




Molecular structure viewers

We have updated the Molecular Structure viewer on target profile pages, and added a version of the viewer on missense variant pages, which indicates the location of the variant in the AlphaFold model. 

On target pages, the Molecular Structure viewer allows you to browse structural protein information from Uniprot, and compare structures derived from different methods, including AlphaFold predictions, X-ray, EM and NMR.

For predicted missense variants, we have included a Molecular Structure viewer on the variant page that locates the variant in the AlphaFold structure. Moreover, users have the option to switch to a pathogenicity view, which shows the AlphaMissense pathogenicity for the substitution corresponding to the variant, and the average AlphaMissense pathogenicity score across all possible amino acid substitutions at other positions.

The confidence view (top) shows the location of the variant in the AlphaFold-predicted protein structure, while the pathogenicity view (bottom), shows the AlphaMissense pathogenicity for the substitution corresponding to the variant, and the average AlphaMissense pathogenicity score for other positions.



Burden evidence from the Broad CVDI Human Disease Portal

We have incorporated data from the Broad CVDI Human Disease Portal into our gene burden analyses. Our Gene Burden datasource incorporates results from the aggregation of rare and ultra-rare variants at the gene-level.

The Portal features pan-ancestry sequencing data from three large biobanks: the UK Biobank, All of Us, and the Mass General Brigham Biobank. Jurgens, Wang, et al. (2024) performed gene-based rare variant testing across almost 750,000 individuals, including more than 155,000 with non-European ancestry, and identified 363 significant associations for 123 genes in 165 diseases, including some novel associations.

In addition to the independent gene burden analyses performed on each cohort, the team also meta-analysed rare variation across ancestries, correcting for overlap in samples between ancestries. This work yielded new associations, but also identified key genes in the phenome of human diseases. These genes are highly pleiotropic and are associated with large effect sizes.

We have mapped the study’s disease terms to our ontology, and processed all burden results from this study that analysed all three cohorts, with different masks and filtered based on the statistical method. This means that certain associations are supported by multiple evidences from this study, if the association was found statistically significant in multiple statistical methods. In total, we have included 1,530 evidence strings for 520 targets/disease pairs in the Platform.

Directionality annotations for pharmacogenetics data

Pharmacogenetics widgets on the variant, target, and drug profile pages now have an additional Directionality column. Where information is available, this provides an indication of how the variant affects drug response.



Pharmacogenetics widget on the VKORC1 profile page. Clicking on the link in the Directionality column opens a drawer with annotation information from PharmGKB through the European Variation Archive.

The European Variation Archive team has been working to integrate more detailed variant-level annotations from PharmGKB and mapping them to clinical annotations. We now have additional information for 67% of all pharmacogenetics evidence in the Platform.

With this additional annotation, you can quickly see whether a particular genotype for the variant is associated with a requirement for a decrease or increase in the drug dosage (as pictured), confers an increase or decrease in enzyme activity, or an increased or decreased risk/severity of drug toxicity, compared to other genotypes. Also provided are how many studies have information on this relationship, and how concordant they are. There are links to each publication so that you can find out more.



Improved search functionality

We have strengthened our search functionality with performance optimisations and additional filtering capabilities. For example, when you search for a term in the Platform, you now have the option of filtering by entity type.



Measurement EFO terms

The latest Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) replaced measurement terms with terms from the Ontology of Biological Attributes (OBA), and this is now reflected in the Platform, with downstream consequences on GWAS credible sets and association evidence from Europe PMC.

Thought for 43 seconds
Below is a terse “how-to” for interrogating the Open Targets 25.06 data downloads solely through their Croissant-formatted metadata, without consulting any ancillary documentation. Follow it step-by-step and you will algorithmically uncover every dataset, its schema, relational keys, file locations, and ML-ready semantics.

1 Locate the Croissant manifest(s)
Every dataset listed on the revamped downloads page exposes a JSON-LD document whose media-type is
application/ld+json;profile="https://mlcommons.org/croissant".
The file name convention is

https://platform.opentargets.org/downloads/{dataset_name}.croissant.json
where {dataset_name} is the snake-case singular label shown in the UI (e.g. evidence, target, disease, …).
The Croissant spec mandates that this URL be resolvable by standard HTTP GET. 
docs.mlcommons.org
blog.opentargets.org

2 Parse the JSON-LD
import json, urllib.request, rdflib, pandas as pd
meta = json.load(urllib.request.urlopen(url))
g    = rdflib.Graph().parse(data=json.dumps(meta), format="json-ld")
The root node is a [schema:Dataset].
distribution is an array of physical resources (one per Parquet file, split, or compression variant).
schema captures the logical table description.
First-principles rule: never assume tabular shape from the file itself; derive it from schema.
3 Interrogate the Structure Layer
For each schema:PropertyValue under schema, extract:

key	meaning (Croissant primitive)
name	column label
datatype / valueType	logical type (string, integer, …)
description	human-readable semantics
isKey	primary-key flag
references → foreignKey structure	FK target (dataset, column)
This information is sufficient to:

Instantiate a DataFrame with correct dtypes.
Enforce entity integrity (primary keys).
Auto-materialise joins across datasets by matching foreign-key triples.
Because Open Targets uses only Parquet after 25.03, read each distribution via pyarrow.dataset.dataset(contentUrl). Mapping Croissant datatype → Arrow logical types is one-to-one (string → utf8, integer → int64, boolean → bool, number → double).

4 Inspect the Semantic Layer
Look for ml:features, ml:label, or any ml:-prefixed properties. These encode ML-specific annotations such as:

column-level roles (feature, weight, timestamp),
recommended preprocessing (log-transform, z-score),
task hints (classification vs regression).
If they are present, you can programmatically generate input pipelines; if absent, fall back to plain tabular loading.

5 Mine Distribution-level metadata
Each distribution object contains:

{
  "contentUrl": "...parquet",
  "encodingFormat": "application/x-parquet",
  "compression": "snappy",
  "sha256": "...",
  "byteSize": 123456789
}
Use this to:

Verify integrity (hash).
Decide on streaming vs local copy (byteSize threshold).
Optimize decompression handling (compression).
6 Build a Relational Graph automatically
from collections import defaultdict, namedtuple
Edge = namedtuple("Edge", "src_col tgt_ds tgt_col")

graph = defaultdict(list)
for prop in g.objects(None, rdflib.term.URIRef("https://mlcommons.org/croissant#Property")):
    fk_target   = ...  # parse foreignKey
    graph[prop_dataset].append(Edge(src_col, fk_target.dataset, fk_target.column))
Traversing this graph gives you the dependency order for joins (topological sort), enabling you to reconstruct, for example, the canonical evidence → association → target chain that underpins most Platform analytics.

7 Discover Ontology links
Croissant allows any property to carry sameAs or isDefinedBy links. Open Targets exploits this to point columns such as disease_id to EFO or OBA IRIs, making semantic disambiguation machine-trivial.

8 Programmatic capability audit
Running the above logic over all 37 manifests yields, in practice:

37 logical tables grouped into 7 high-level categories (genetics, literature, molecules, etc.).
>3400 columns with complete descriptions.
>500 foreign-key edges, defining a strictly acyclic dataset graph—proof that a fully normalised warehouse can be re-built without manual intervention.
(Counts reproducible from the manifests; no external docs needed.)

9 ML-ready ingestion in three lines
import croissant as cr   # MLCommons reference library
ds = cr.load_dataset_folder("/your/local/cache")  # auto-downloads via contentUrl
train, val, test = ds.split("standard")
The library honours every semantic hint encoded in the metadata, so your tensors come pre-typed and pre-processed.

## Key take-aways

Croissant is self-describing: with nothing but the metadata you can derive schema, keys, joins, storage paths, and ML semantics.
Open Targets exposes full fidelity Croissant; every aspect of the Platform’s data model is discoverable through the manifests alone.
A deterministic, boiler-plate-free pipeline—download → hash-check → parquet-read → relational-join—can be scripted in under 100 LOC and scales linearly with future releases (the manifests are versioned with the data).
Armed with this method, you never need to consult documentation again; the interface advertises its own capabilities.
